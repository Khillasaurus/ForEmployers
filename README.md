# EMPLOYER GUIDE  
Welcome to my github!  
  
This repository contains new, old, complete and incomplete work of which all of it may not be relevant to the position in question.  
Please request a tour of my code if you are looking into hiring me, so that I can guide you to relevant code.  
  
This is not a showcase of only my best work, but rather a majority of all my work, regardless of quality.  
This is done on purpose both for personal utility, as well to show my learning progression.  
  
Lastly, my GitHub serves as a portal to my code for the world, and thus a repository may only receive major updates instead of all updates.  
A lack of updates does not mean that the code is not being worked on. Work logs are available upon request.  
# LAYOUT  
Major projects go in their own section, while all minor projects fit under one of the following categories:  
## Minor Project Categories  
Complete  
ForEmployers  
InProgress  
School  
Work  
## Major Projects  
GameEngine  
# NOTES  
1. In the case of continued work beyond the scope of its initial minor project category,  
a copy of the project will be created under its own Major Project repository,  
in which all future work will be continued.  
This maintains a record of the state of the work prior to category shift.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. A school project turns is revived and continued post graduation.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History of the project during the school era is maintained,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while allowing for future work on the revived new version.
